- **Description**: The ABI Prism 3700 was a capillary electrophoresis DNA sequencer that used laser-excited fluorescent dye terminators to read genetic code at industrial speeds. This instrument was the workhorse of the Human Genome Project, enabling the complete sequencing of 3 billion base pairs of human DNA. It transformed biology from a descriptive science into a data-driven, digital discipline.

### The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)
- **Date**: 2021
- **Inventor**: NASA / ESA / CSA 
- **Country**: International Collaboration
- **Origin**: International
- **Impact**: An origami-style golden eye that observes deep time in infrared, witness to the birth of the very first stars in the cosmos.
- **Description**: The James Webb Space Telescope is the most powerful space observatory ever built, featuring a 6.5-meter gold-plated beryllium mirror that unfolds like origami after launch. Operating at the L2 Lagrange point and observing in infrared, JWST can detect light from the first galaxies that formed after the Big Bang, peering back over 13.5 billion years into cosmic history.
